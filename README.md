# Project2-Green-Team
Authors: Aly Smith, Gabriel Hernandez, Pramit Ghosh, Sasikanth Vutukuru, Bill Ulrich
Our team is going to be exploring Spotify to find if there are any similarities between the music components of the top 100 tracks on Spotify.

We'll be web scrapping Spotify for the top 100 track names and then pull specific data for each track via the Spotify API.

With the cleaned data, we'll create visualizations that will help us compare and determine what qualities the top tracks have in common.

We'll be splitting up tasks into smaller teams: Web-Scrapping: Gabe API Requests: Aly, Sasi Basic Site Structure: Bill Visualizations: Pramit, Sasi
